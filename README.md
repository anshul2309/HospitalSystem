# HospitalSystem
In this project called Hospital System, i made use of python language.

This can be used by hospital to treat patients who are unconscious and cannot tell about their details while in emergency.

This software will give a unique id to every patient, and whenever the patient comes to the hospital next time, all his details will be ready with th hospital, the hospital just has to scan his face to get the unique id. 
This will be very helpful when the the person comes to the hospital in an emergency situation, and he cannot tell his blood type or any other heal related details. The hospital just needs to scan his face and will get all his health details and can operate on him immediately 
as they will know all the paramets like blood type etc.

Only constraint is that the person must have visited the hospital atleast once.  He just has to make his details go in the hospital once. 

// Software working

The webcam first will take  the photos of the person and store it and assign him a unique id.

The hospital staff will store all his information in the their system.

The next time person comes unconscious, they can just scan his face and get all his previous health records and operate on him immediately.
